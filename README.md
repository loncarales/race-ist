## 🕹️ Research and Analysis on RaceAssist: A Vision-Based, Gesture-Driven Game Control System for Real-Time Steering Interfaces Using MediaPipe and PyAutoGUI


---

### 📄 **Abstract**

In an era increasingly driven by touchless interaction and immersive computing, **RaceAssist** explores an intuitive and low-cost alternative to traditional game controllers through real-time **gesture-based input systems**. This research investigates the development and evolution of *RaceAssist*, a modular, vision-powered interface enabling users to control racing games using only their hand gestures, captured through a standard webcam and interpreted using **MediaPipe** for landmark detection and **PyAutoGUI** for simulated keystrokes.

The project presents a comparative study of **nine evolving control models**, ranging from basic zone-based wrist detection to advanced multi-threaded pipelines and gesture-recognition-enhanced input. Key challenges such as gesture ambiguity, input flickering, and detection latency are systematically addressed through novel solutions including **turn decay logic**, **2-hand brake state inference**, and **parallel control architecture**.

The study evaluates each version across metrics of **usability, responsiveness, and cognitive load**, contributing insights into designing effective gesture-based HCI systems. The final version (v9) integrates a robust 3x3 control grid with intelligent input decay and flicker suppression, showing high promise for real-world applicability in both recreational gaming and experimental HCI setups.

This research aims to demonstrate how **accessible hardware and open-source CV tools** can be leveraged to create **fluid, natural, and expressive interfaces**, especially relevant for users in accessibility contexts, human-robot interaction prototypes, or low-cost simulation environments. Future work includes exploring **analog gesture mapping**, **AI-based gesture classification**, and **VR/XR integrations**, advancing toward adaptive, personalized gesture interaction systems.

## 🧪 Challenges Faced & How They Were Addressed

### 🧩 1. **Single Process Consumes All Key Input**

> **Problem**: Regardless of how many keys were sent via `pyautogui`, only one key was effectively recognized at a time in terminal-based or focused game windows.

**Why it happens**:
Most terminal or native Windows processes buffer only one keystroke at a time. Also, `pyautogui` simulates key events sequentially in the same thread, which isn’t truly parallel.

**How I addressed it**:

* Introduced **simulated key-holding** (e.g., hold `w` + tap `a`) instead of toggling.
* Added **interleaved multi-press loops** in `v8` and cooldown decay logic in `v9` for more natural control.
* Future fix: implement **parallel input injection** via tools like **`pynput`, `autopy`, or native OS key injection APIs**.

---

### 🕒 2. **Detection Latency Even on High-End Laptops**

> **Problem**: Hand tracking and landmark processing (especially via MediaPipe) lagged even on high-performance systems.

**Root Cause**:

* Real-time webcam + landmark model inference on CPU is expensive.
* Frame drops occur due to **sequential logic** (acquire → process → act → display).

**How I addressed it**:

* In **v4**, introduced **multi-threading** (capture, detect, control, display) using Python `threading`.
* Reduced `max_num_hands` to 1 when possible to cut computation by \~40%.
* Future fix: use **GPU-based** inference via **MediaPipe with TensorFlow GPU**, or shift to **OpenVINO / ONNX**.

---

### 🌍 3. **Varying Environment Light & Backgrounds**

> **Problem**: Different lighting conditions affected detection accuracy and stability.

**Fixes Tried**:

* Placed detection thresholds like `min_detection_confidence=0.7`, `min_tracking_confidence=0.7`.
* Added **visual guidance lines** (zones, wrist dots) to help user adjust hand positions.
* Future fix: integrate **background-agnostic tracking models** or **depth sensors** (e.g., Intel RealSense).

---

### 🎛️ 4. **Directional Intensity Is Too Binary**

> **Problem**: Left/right turns are **quantized**, meaning you're either turning or you're not->there’s no in-between.

**Effect**: Sudden jumps can cause **flickering**, especially near zone boundaries.

**Fix**:

* In `v9`, introduced a **cooldown + decay mechanism** so rapid hand jitter doesn’t retrigger the same action.
* Future fix:

  * Introduce a **"steering stabilizer"**: use smoothing techniques like **moving average** or **Kalman filter** on `wrist.x`.
  * Convert position to analog signal → **gradual turning (e.g., a=light, aa=hard left)**.

---

### 🔁 5. **No Natural Recovery Mechanism (Left to Straight to Right)**

> **Problem**: Transitioning from left to center and then to right feels abrupt -> no counterbalancing inertia.

**Solution Concept**:

* Implement a **momentum model** where zone transition logic includes "direction recovery":

  ```text
  If coming from 'Left', don't trigger 'Right' unless passed through 'Center' for N frames.
  ```
* Future idea: use **virtual steering wheel state**, which smoothly rotates and settles back to center over time.
